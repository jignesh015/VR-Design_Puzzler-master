The Puzzler VRÂ App
This article describes the step by step process I undertook to develop the beta version of the Puzzler VR app. I completed this project over a long weekend, making multiple iterations to it so that the app can be presentable enough to publish. Following are the respective version of tools/resources I used to develop the game.
Unity LTS Release 2017.4.4(https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases?version=2017.4)
GVR SDK for Unity v1.100.1(https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/releases/tag/v1.100.1)
iTween(https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/itween-84) v2.0.9

The final gameplay as of the latest version looks like this:
